# Appreciation On Tips Experiment
Effects of Expressing Gratitude for Shopping Local via Sign on Tipping Behavior

## Abstract
In recent times, there has been a significant push to increase tipping culture and support local businesses. While many studies could be conducted to analyze the impact of these trends, this study instead focuses on actionable and attainable steps a local business can take to increase tips for their staff. This study explores the influence of expressing appreciation for supporting local businesses on consumer tipping behavior. In collaboration with MCM Coffee, a coffee shop in New York City, we conducted an experiment where a sign that reads “Thank you for supporting local” was placed next to the register on treatment days and removed on control days, and we compared the tipping behavior between the treatment and control groups. All customers who visited the coffee shop within the two week experiment period who paid with a credit or debit card were assigned to either the treatment (N = 848) or control group (N = 683) depending on the date of their purchase. The results suggested that on average, the treatment group tipped 1.08% higher than the control group, although this increase was not significant at the 5% level. Future experiments should consider increasing the sample size and controlling for additional covariates, such as the day of the week or the barista, to further investigate this causal relationship.

## Hypotheses
The specific hypotheses for this experiment are:
Null Hypothesis (H0): Displaying an appreciation sign does not increase the tipping percentage of customers at MCM Coffee Shop.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Displaying an appreciation sign increases the tipping percentage of customers at MCM Coffee Shop.
We anticipate that the appreciation sign will lead to a statistically significant increase in tipping percentages based on the principle of reciprocity and the positive results observed in similar studies.

## Potential Outcomes
1. Treatment Group Outcome (Y1): The average tipping percentage on days when the appreciation sign is displayed. This is calculated at the transactional level as the tip amount divided by the before-tax sales amount for each transaction.
2. Control Group Outcome (Y0): The average tipping percentage on days when the appreciation sign is not displayed. This is calculated at the transactional level in the same manner as the treatment group.
